# Password-Creator
A simple app that generates random password and makes it easier for you when you must think of new passwords when creating new accounts.

THE PURPOSE of this app is to help people when they create new accounts. It is important that one chooses strong and secure password when creating new account. At the same time some platforms limit the length and/or the type of characters which can be used when creating passwords. So, this app makes it easier for people to create their new passwords when creating new accounts.

This is done by building a new password by randomly chosen characters which the app generates.

THE ARCHITECTURE of this app is based on MVC pattern, consisting of Data model package, FXML-file and a Controller class.

The Data model consists of two classes - Source Class (the source of characters which will be used in the creation of the password) and PasswordCreator Class (where the password is being generated).

The graphical user interface is styled on CSS.
